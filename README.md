# Hi, I'm Jim (they/them)

I'm a senior cloud architect and tech lead working at the intersection of distributed systems, modern cloud platforms, and applied artificial intelligence. My professional focus spans .NET and the Azure ecosystem, DevOps and GitOps workflows, container orchestration with Kubernetes, and agentic AI applications. I have a strong track record of building scalable SaaS platforms, leading cross‑functional teams, and bridging the gap between infrastructure, backend, and product direction.  My contributions have earned recognition in the TNW T500 and Dutch Championships for software development.

## Professional passions

I enjoy designing resilient architectures for real‑time and high‑throughput workloads. Over the past several years I've led initiatives around event‑driven architectures, microservice modernization, and AI‑powered automation.  I believe in balancing pragmatism with long‑term maintainability: choosing the right tool for the job, favouring infrastructure‑as‑code and GitOps, and investing in robust CI/CD and observability pipelines.  When possible I try to advance the state of the art. My current work on projects like **HecatonAI** and **Embers** explores how large language models and agentic systems can drive end‑to‑end automation, from infrastructure provisioning to feature development.

I'm a longtime supporter of open‑source.  I contribute to and maintain public repositories, and advocate for transparency and collaborative innovation in all my projects.  My GitHub profile highlights a mixture of personal tools and forks—ranging from a Formula 1 race‑timing client in C# to small utilities like **buniform** reflecting my diverse interests.

## Get in touch

If you're interested in distributed systems, applied AI, or collaborative software design, feel free to reach out.  You can find me on **X** (formerly Twitter) at [@TheAnarchoX](https://twitter.com/TheAnarchoX).  I'm always open to discussing new ideas, mentoring, or exploring potential collaborations.
